# Grading Scale: check(+) --> excellent codes and analysis
                 check    --> satisfactory (missing small gaps in analysis or codes)
                 check(-) --> unsatisfactory (significant problems with codes/analysis or incomplete)  

Your Milne results look like they should, but as you pointed out, something seems slightly amiss with Simpson's rule. 
(Questions to troubleshoot-- Did you Did you try other integrands? Or try polynomials of degree 3 or less where
we know Simpson's is exact?)

  
Grade: check
